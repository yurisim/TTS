gpn-01|might i just add it is great to be in nashville.
gpn-02|thank you so much chancellor for that warm welcome and thank you to everyone at vanderbilt for what i think will be a very very productive next couple days to have a discussion about the emerging trends uh the emerging threats how we're looking atmodern conflict of the future.
gpn-03|so as we start today i thought it might be good just to baseline and tell you a little bit about myself because i think that informs some of my thinking obviously, the experiences that i've had, what we've tried to do in terms of our activities at the national security agency u.s cyber command but also my thoughts about the near mid and long term opportunities and challenges our nation faces
gpn-04|so as the chancellor mentioned i'm an army officer with 35 years of experience. i came into the army
gpn-05|in a much different time during the reagan administration.
gpn-06|we were in the midst or i guess at that time we didn't realize it but at the end of the cold war.
gpn-07|as we looked at what we faced at the time it clearly was one central adversary and that was the soviet union.
gpn-08|over a course of assignments i found myself
gpn-09|at the pentagon on the 11th of september 2001
gpn-10|a fairly significant day obviously for all of us in our nation in the world
gpn-11|but from that time like many of the officers of my generation
gpn-12|and many of the officers i serve with today for the next two decades we found ourselves
gpn-13|in a series of deployments and activities
gpn-14|and a focused nature with regards to counterterrorism and violent extremist organizations.
gpn-15|but for myself i would tell you that there was an opportunity in 2007 when i arrived at the national security agency
gpn-16|to take over a unit that was focused on support to military operations.
gpn-17|my first time at fort meade
gpn-18|i was amazed at the technology.
gpn-19|i was amazed at the trade craft.
gpn-20|but i will tell you the fundamentalthing that amazed me was was the talent.
gpn-21|because after everything that is done at the national security agency and even u.s cyber command,
gpn-22|the key piece that sets us apart
gpn-23|is our talent.
gpn-24|in 2009 i had the opportunity working for then director general keith alexander to work amongst a team of four individuals to put together what then was an idea
gpn-25|that became u.s cyber command.
gpn-26|what do we base that idea off of?
gpn-27|well first of all we base that idea off of our experiences in 2008 with regards to operation buckshot yankee and for those of you that don't recall operation buckshot yankee, it was an adversary's penetration of our classified networks in the united states.
gpn-28|but here's the other thing that we based u.s cyber command off of that was our experience as many of us who had deployed in and out of afghanistan for a period of time
gpn-29|regarding what the national security agency could do
gpn-30|in terms of bringing outcomes to the nation we had seen the power of the cryptologic system and as we thought about how u.s cyber command needed to form grow and be able to be relevant in a very changing world we knew that part of that had to be based upon and a large part of it with an association in partnership
gpn-31|with the national security agency.
gpn-32|so i am as the commander of u.s cyber command and the director of the national security agency
gpn-33|headquartered at fort meade maryland.
gpn-34|now the great news about fort meade maryland is you are 26.2 miles that's one marathon away from the pentagon.
gpn-35|now the challenging news about being at fort meade maryland is you're
gpn-36|26.2 miles away from the pentagon
gpn-37|today marks my fourth year in the job. i just realized that yesterday as we were flying into nashville time flies
gpn-38|but what i would tell you over the past four years is my experience in terms of what i'm seeing in this
gpn-39|ever changing domain
gpn-40|really is wrapped up in three different ideas first of all,
gpn-41|is this idea of how much the strategic landscape has changed in terms of where we're operating
gpn-42|go and look no further than the actors that we are focused on today.
gpn-43|even two years ago none of us would think at the national security agency and u.s cyber command that ransomware was anything but
gpn-44|a law enforcement activity
gpn-45|secondly is i would offer that in the past four years the nation's understanding of cyber security
gpn-46|has grown significantly and look no further than
gpn-47|colonial pipeline in the spring of 2021.
gpn-48|this brought to our idea the idea that i have often said that
gpn-49|cyber security is national security.
gpn-50|and the third piece i would tell you
gpn-51|in the past four years is just the growing relevance capability and outputs
gpn-52|of what the national security agency has been able to do both in terms of its foreign intelligence mission delivering the insights and the indications and warning that are so critical to our nation
gpn-53|but also as you will hear shortly
gpn-54|the cyber security efforts of what our agency has been able to do
gpn-55|not even in existence four years ago what we've been able to do over the past two years with regards to our insights to what is happening in this domain bringing the outcomes of what our nation needs and being able to work with a series of partners
gpn-56|to develop a much secure ecosystem.
gpn-57|but it's not just the national security agency i would tell you also u.s cyber command as i look at the command today four years into it
gpn-58|i see a command with much greater capabilities a command that has been able to utilize its capacity authorities and outcomes in a series of different very significant events for our nation whether or not it's been election security whether or not it's been actions against iranian uh extremists or whether or not it's been the recent ransomware activities.
gpn-59|this is a command that has come into its own.
gpn-60|zch
gpn-61|so as was mentioned i'm in a fairly unique position. i am both the commander of a combatant command i'm the director of the largest element of the u.s intelligence community. why is that important? because i would tell you it's important
gpn-62|being able to move with speed in a domain that requires it, being able to be agile to threats that require it, and being able to do it with a unity of effort
gpn-63|that our agency and command can do today.
gpn-64|let's talk a little bit about the command and the agency. just to uh just to baseline everyone in terms of what we do so if you take a look at u.s cyber command in our parlance we think we are a startup, 12 years old as of next month. we have a thousand folks in our headquarters and we have about 20,000 amongst our commands
gpn-65|we do three things for the nation first of all we defend our DOD networks.
gpn-66|our dod networks our weapon systems and our data. you'd say well how big of a an issue is that? well we have about we have about 15,000 classified and unclassified networks that come together to make the dod information network. we have about 4.5 million endpoints on this network. we have about 3.5 million users and we have about 600,000 mobile subscribers
gpn-67|the other thing that we do is we provide support to a wide variety of joint force commanders joint force commanders that are in this room today in terms of what we're able to do in places like
gpn-68|iraq in places like europe and places like the pacific
gpn-69|if it's non-kinetic support over a spectrum of offense defense information operations this is what u.s cyber command is generated to do
gpn-70|and then the last thing that we do is
gpn-71|we do defense of the nation cyberspace with a series of other actors within our government. working with the department of homeland security, the federal bureau of investigation. look no further than our ability to defend elections in 2018 2020 being able to address the challenges of ransomware in 2021.
gpn-72|this is the third output that the the command is able to focus on.
gpn-73|how about the national security agencies we take a look at nsa our two missions and after 70 years of doing this i think missions that are well established
gpn-74|first of all signals intelligence operating outside the united states how do we provide the deep insights of our adversaries to provide a national information advantage
gpn-75|to our policy makers
gpn-76|and commanders in competition crisis and conflict and secondly our cyber security mission
gpn-77|preventing and eradicate cyber threats to u.s national security systems
gpn-78|critical infrastructure focused mainly on our defense industrial base
gpn-79|we do this in primarily five different locations maryland georgia texas hawaii and colorado
gpn-80|but we have a global presence with a series of partners
gpn-81|and if you take a look at the agency and the command and you were to say what's the competitive advantage of these two organizations?
gpn-82|i would offer the following: first of all it begins as i said with our people. it is our talent that separates us no doubt
gpn-83|secondly for u.s cyber command it's our capacity to be able to bring 133 teams offense defense and 14 teams in the future to this growing domain
gpn-84|is something that the command can do today
gpn-85|third
gpn-86|no one in the world makes code or breaks code like the national security agency
gpn-87|we are the best at it and we will remain the best at it that is our parlance in terms of our dna
gpn-88|today we're going to talk about partnerships and i would tell you that is the fourth element of strength of what our agency and command can do. a series of partnerships whether or not they're international partnerships, interagency partnerships, industry partnerships, or today academic partnerships. this is something that we see as critical for our lifeblood for our success for our future
gpn-89|and then finally
gpn-90|it's being able to get after technically
gpn-91|tough and challenging missions.
gpn-92|that's what our agency and commander are known for.
gpn-93|we go after the hardest of the hard the most difficult networks,
gpn-94|the secrets that our adversaries want to protect.
gpn-95|that's what we do in day in and day out
gpn-96|so one of the things we'll talk about today that i think is so important is just this the changing nature of the strategic environment upon which we live in. now i mentioned the fact that i came in in a world that was really bipolar.\, today certainly a multi-polar world as we look at it and i would say the first element of the strategic environment that is so different is this growing complex and contested world in which we operate
gpn-97|we have expanding domains as we all know it used to be land air sea when i came in now it's certainly space and cyberspace and if you think about space and cyberspace no longer the purview of any one nation any one government but a multitude of actors to including the commercial sector.
gpn-98|but we're also seeing the increasing importance of space and cyberspace to elements of our national power
gpn-99|the other piece of this changing and complex and contested environment we live in today is this idea of asymmetric threats
gpn-100|as the senators talked about on their opening, the thought of hypersonics, the thought of ballistic missiles, the ability for nations to touch us where two oceans no longer provide us security is something different.
gpn-101|it's also the information on social media space that operates today
gpn-102|so think about how much differently we think about homeland defense
gpn-103|in the department of defense
gpn-104|go forward
gpn-105|and this last piece of this increasingly complex and contested world is the idea of trans border threats
gpn-106|you know we certainly will talk about cyberspace today. we certainly know about climate change
gpn-107|but i would tell you very honestly after 26 months if someone would have told me in march of 2020 that we would still be looking at a global pandemic impacting our agency in command that's something we didn't think about but this is the world in which we live today.
gpn-108|here are the other elements of a strategic environment that i think that are important for us to think about.
gpn-109|perhaps none more as none more as stark is the rise of china as a pacing challenge.
gpn-110|i think of it both as a sprint in a marathon as i think about china for the past two decades as we have in this nation focused very very hard on the threats that were facing our nation. from counter-terrorism, violent extremist organizations
gpn-111|china did not
gpn-112|and china had the capacity to grow and to be able to impact what they want to do in their own region
gpn-113|but the other thing that's also so very interesting are the numbers that come to us in 1973 if you were to take a look at the gdp of china 113 billion with a b
gpn-114|dollars in 2020, dollars
gpn-115|2020
gpn-116|china's gdp 14.9 trillion with a t
gpn-117|the u.s in 2020 20.7 trillion
gpn-118|there has been a tremendous growth in the military of china as we all know both in terms of its size, capability, presence
gpn-119|its desire to move from a regional to a global power. if you take a look economically at their discussions with regards to china 2025 and the top 10 industries that they're looking to impact
gpn-120|industries like automotive
gpn-121|pharmaceuticals, IT
gpn-122|industries that traditionally have been the purview of the united states are obviously the target of the chinese and perhaps the area that i would say is most challenging to us is the changing risk calculus we see with the chinese
gpn-123|a risk calculus that's informed militarily by their operations in the south china sea and the east china sea,
gpn-124|diplomatically with their wolf diplomacy efforts,
gpn-125|economically with their belt and road initiative,
gpn-126|and informationally
gpn-127|with their continued operations against those that will challenge their message.
